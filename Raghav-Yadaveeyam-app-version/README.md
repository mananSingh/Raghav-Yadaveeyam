### About Shri Raghav Yadaviyam
Composed by Sri Venkatadhvari (a master in poetry and rhetoric, in 17th Century), Shri Raghav Yadaviyam is a wondrous work of Sanskrit, containing 30 verses, where each shloka has an unusual double-meaning-when-reversed nature.
When read in the usual order of composition, the shlokas narrate the story of Raghav - Ramayana; and when read in the reverse order, the shlokas narrates the episode from the life of Krishna/Yadav - of bringing parijata tree from heaven to earth.

### Note on Usage

Troubleshooting: The app will only work correctly when uploaded on a running server (e.g. apache, app engine, etc.). The reason is the CORS request won't work otherwise. And the CORS request is essential to fetch and use the .json files which this app uses.
